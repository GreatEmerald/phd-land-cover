	abstract = {Outputs of soft classification inherently contain uncertainty. As an input for the sub-pixel mapping (SPM) method, the uncertainty is propagated to SPM result especially the boundary region between classes. Therefore, reducing the uncertainty within the outputs of soft classification is worth exploring. This paper firstly utilizes multiple-point simulation (MPS) through training images for characterizing the spatial structural properties of a surface object/class. Consequently, MPS results are used to increase the accuracy of the fraction image of the surface object/class. The improved fraction image then inputs to the SPM method for producing the land cover map with finer spatial resolution. In order to validate the proposed method, a remotely sensed image from Landsat TM 30m over the Qianyanzhou red earth hill region in China is used. This experimental study not only compares the results from SPM with improved fraction images with MPS and results from SPM with original fraction images, but also investigates the performances of different soft classifiers. It has been demonstrated that this proposed method is an effective way to reduce the uncertainty in outputs of different soft classification, increase the recognition accuracies of boundary regions and thus increase the accuracies of SPM simulated images.},

	abstract = {Mapping rural land cover features, such as trees and hedgerows, for ecological applications is a desirable component of the creation of cartographic maps by the Ordnance Survey. Based on the phenomenon of spatial dependence, sub‐pixel mapping can provide increased mapping accuracy of such features. A simple pixel‐swapping algorithm for sub‐pixel mapping was applied to soft classified fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery. Initially, QuickbirdTM satellite sensor imagery with a spatial resolution of 2.6 m was acquired of the Christchurch area of Dorset, UK, and three field sites chosen. The imagery was soft classified using a supervised fuzzy c‐means algorithm and then super‐resolved into sub‐pixels using a zoom factor of five. Sub‐pixels within pixels were then iteratively swapped until the spatial correlation between sub‐pixels for the entire image was maximized. Mathematical morphology was used to suppress error in the super‐resolved output, increasing overall accuracy. Field data, including detailed information on the features apparent in the field sites, were used to assess the accuracy of the resultant image. Overall RMSE was between 20 and 30\%, resulting in the sub‐pixel mapping method producing reasonably accurate results overall of between 50 and 75\%. Visual inspection of the super‐resolved output shows that the prediction of the position and dimensions of hedgerows was comparable with the original imagery.},

	abstract = {Super-resolution land-cover mapping is a promising technology for prediction of the spatial distribution of each land-cover class at the sub-pixel scale. This distribution is often determined based on the principle of spatial dependence and from land-cover fraction images derived with soft classification technology. However, the resulting super-resolution land-cover maps often have uncertainty as no information about sub-pixel land-cover patterns within the low-resolution pixels is used in the model. Accuracy can be improved by incorporating supplemental datasets to provide more land-cover information at the sub-pixel scale; but the effectiveness of this is limited by the availability and quality of these additional datasets. In this paper, a novel super-resolution land-cover mapping technology is proposed, which uses multiple sub-pixel shifted remotely sensed images taken by observation satellites. These satellites take images over the same area once every several days, but the images are not identical because of slight orbit translations. Low-resolution pixels in these remotely sensed images therefore contain different land-cover fractions that can provide useful information for super-resolution land-cover mapping. We have constructed a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) model to solve it. Maximum spatial dependence is the goal of the proposed model, and the fraction maps of all images are constraints added to the energy function of HNN. The model was applied to synthetic artificial images as well as to a real degraded QuickBird image. The output maps derived from different numbers of images at different zoom factors were compared visually and quantitatively to the super-resolution map generated from a single image. The resulting land-cover maps with multiple remotely sensed images were more accurate than was the single image map. The use of multiple remotely sensed images is therefore a promising method for decreasing the uncertainty of super-resolution land-cover mapping. Moreover, remotely sensed images with similar spatial resolution from different satellite platforms can be used together, allowing a fusion of information obtained from remotely sensed imagery.},

	abstract = {The existence of mixed pixels is a major problem in remote-sensing image classification. Although the soft classification and spectral unmixing techniques can obtain an abundance of different classes in a pixel to solve the mixed pixel problem, the subpixel spatial attribution of the pixel will still be unknown. The subpixel mapping technique can effectively solve this problem by providing a fine-resolution map of class labels from coarser spectrally unmixed fraction images. However, most traditional subpixel mapping algorithms treat all mixed pixels as an identical type, either boundary-mixed pixel or linear subpixel, leading to incomplete and inaccurate results. To improve the subpixel mapping accuracy, this paper proposes an adaptive subpixel mapping framework based on a multiagent system for remote-sensing imagery. In the proposed multiagent subpixel mapping framework, three kinds of agents, namely, feature detection agents, subpixel mapping agents and decision agents, are designed to solve the subpixel mapping problem. Experiments with artificial images and synthetic remote-sensing images were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed subpixel mapping algorithm in comparison with the hard classification method and other subpixel mapping algorithms: subpixel mapping based on a back-propagation neural network and the spatial attraction model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other two subpixel mapping algorithms in reconstructing the different structures in mixed pixels.},

	abstract = {There is a type of algorithm for subpixel mapping (SPM), namely, the soft-then-hard SPM (STHSPM) algorithm that first estimates soft attribute values for land cover classes at the subpixel scale level and then allocates classes (i.e., hard attribute values) for subpixels according to the soft attribute values. This paper presents a novel class allocation approach for STHSPM algorithms, which allocates classes in units of class (UOC). First, a visiting order for all classes is predetermined, and the number of subpixels belonging to each class is calculated using coarse fraction data. Then, according to the visiting order, the subpixels belonging to the being visited class are determined by comparing the soft attribute values of this class, and the remaining subpixels are used for the allocation of the next class. The process is terminated when each subpixel is allocated to a class. UOC was tested on three remote sensing images with five STHSPM algorithms: back-propagation neural network, Hopfield neural network, subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model, kriging, and indicator cokriging. UOC was also compared with three existing allocation methods, i.e., linear optimization technique (LOT), sequential assignment in units of subpixel (UOS), and a method that assigns subpixels with highest soft attribute values first (HAVF). Results show that for all STHSPM algorithms, UOC is able to produce higher SPM accuracy than UOS and HAVF; compared with LOT, UOC is able to achieve at least comparable accuracy but needs much less computing time. Hence, UOC provides an effective and real-time class allocation method for STHSPM algorithms.},

Unlike conventional pixel-swapping algorithms, STPSA is capable of utilizing prior information, which was previously ignored, to predict the attractiveness based on pairs of subpixels. This algorithm involves three main steps and operates in an iterative manner: 1) it predicts the maximum and minimum attractiveness of each pair of pixels; 2) ranks the swapping scores based on the attractiveness of all the pairs; and 3) swaps the locations of the pair of pixels with a maximum score to increase the objective function. Experiments with actual satellite images have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms. In comparison, the proposed STPSA's better performance is due to the fact that prior information used in other algorithms is restricted to a percentage level rather than the real subpixel level.},

In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR\_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR\_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR\_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms. The results show that SVR\_SRM can generate fine resolution land cover maps with more detailed spatial information and higher accuracy at different spatial scales.},

In reality, training images are not always available, or laborious work is needed to acquire them. This paper aims to seek spatial structure information for ICK when such prior land cover information is not obtainable. Specifically, the fine spatial resolution semivariogram of each class is estimated by the deconvolution process, taking the coarse spatial resolution semivariogram extracted from the class proportion image as input. The obtained fine spatial resolution semivariogram is then used to estimate class occurrence probability at each subpixel with the ICK method. Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed ICK with the deconvolution approach. It obtains comparable SPM accuracy to ICK that requires semivariogram estimated from fine spatial resolution training images. The proposed method extends ICK to cases where the prior spatial structure information is unavailable.},

However, monitoring or updating of map products with sufficient spatial detail is currently not widely practiced due to inadequate time-series coverage for most regions of the Earth. Classifications of coarser spatial resolution data can be automatically generated on an annual or finer time scale. However, discrete land cover classifications of such data cannot sufficiently quantify land surface heterogeneity or change. This study presents a methodology for continuous and discrete land cover mapping using moderate spatial resolution time series data sets. The method automatically selects sample data from higher spatial resolution maps and generates multiple decision trees. The leaves of decision trees are interpreted considering the sample distribution of all classes yielding class membership maps, which can be used as estimates for the diversity of classes in a coarse resolution cell. Results are demonstrated for the heterogeneous, small-patch landscape of Germany and the bio-climatically varying landscape of South Africa. Results have overall classification accuracies of 80\%. A sensitivity analysis of individual modules of the classification process indicates the importance of appropriately chosen features, sample data balanced among classes, and an appropriate method to combine individual classifications. The comparison of classification results over several years not only indicates the method's consistency, but also its potential to detect land cover changes.},

At the same time, they find that bias in sampling certain classes actually leads to better accuracies. In other words, good to sample more for classes that are hard to distinguish.
Using fractional mapping is more accurate than discretising it.
Did land cover updating too! Noticed that yearly variability (dryer/wetter years) are represented, transitional zones change. For statistics, they subtracted and looked for each class for positive or negative changes for a barchart, and also a spatial map with paired year comparisons.
Says that users usually want a discrete map, but that can be generated, and you even get a "confidence" measure.
Fractional mapping is great for transition zones and mixed landscapes. Says that it's not great to include mosaic classes, but rather it would be better to just have pure classes and derive the mixed ones from them (but they didn't test!)
Touts that it's stable and doesn't show significant false changes between the years.

Four different fuzzy classifiers are considered for this purpose and evaluated using different wavelet features. Wavelet feature based fuzzy classifiers produced consistently better results compared to original spectral feature based methods on various images used in the present investigation. Further, the performance of the Biorthogonal3.3 (Bior3.3) wavelet is observed to be superior to other wavelets.

Tested wavelet transform to get spatiotemporal multispectral features, then fed it to models: fuzzy k-NN, fuzzy ML, fuzzy explicit and fuzzy product aggregation reasoning rule (FPARR).
Suggests first analysing coarse pixels, then finer ones, in order to take context into account. That's how wavelet transform works: you decompose components into sort of edge-detects of horizontal, vertical and diagonal, and you build up pyramid layers. Then that data can be fed into a classifier, and it contains information about the spatial context too.
Fuzzy k-NN is basically fuzzy c-means, except that it takes k neighbours' centroids rather than the centroid of the whole set. It will be the same if k=N. (Actually, supervised fuzzy c-means is in fact a fuzzy nearest centroid classifier.)
Wavelet transform helps with separation of classes, and the resulting hard imagery is also very slightly better. They didn't look into a confusion matrix, though, and the classes were a bit arbitrary (probably from clustering).
Fuzzy k-NN and fuzzy ML were the worst, fuzzy explicit (similar to FuzzyNPC) was better, and FRBS was the best, with or without wavelet data.},

	abstract = {Recent researches have used geographically weighted variables calculated for two tree species, Cryptomeria japonica (Sugi, or Japanese Cedar) and Chamaecyparis obtusa (Hinoki, or Japanese Cypress) to classify the two species and one mixed forest class. In machine learning context it has been found to be difficult to predict that a pixel belongs to a specific class in a heterogeneous landscape image, especially in forest images, as ground features of nearly located pixel of different classes have very similar spectral characteristics. In the present work the authors have proposed a GA trained Neural Network classifier to tackle the task. The local search based traditional weight optimization algorithms may get trapped in local optima and may be poor in training the network. NN trained with GA (NN-GA) overcomes the problem by gradually optimizing the input weight vector of the NN. The performance of NN-GA has been compared with NN, SVM and Random Forest classifiers in terms of performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure and Kappa Statistic. The results have been found to be satisfactory and a reasonable improvement has been made over the existing performances in the literature by using NN-GA.},

	abstract = {There is a certain degree of ambiguity associated with remote sensing as a means of performing earth observations. Using interval-valued data to describe clustering prototype features may be more suitable for handling the fuzzy nature of remote sensing data, which is caused by the uncertainty and heterogeneity in the surface spectral reflectance of ground objects. After constructing a multi-spectral interval-valued model of source data and defining a distance measure to achieve the maximum dissimilarity between intervals, an interval-valued fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm that considers both the functional characteristics of fuzzy clustering algorithms and the interregional features of ground object spectral reflectance was applied in this study. Such a process can significantly improve the clustering effect; specifically, the process can reduce the synonym spectrum phenomenon and the misclassification caused by the overlap of spectral features between classes of clustering results. Clustering analysis experiments aimed at land cover classification using remote sensing imagery from the SPOT-5 satellite sensor for the Pearl River Delta region, China, and the TM sensor for Yushu, Qinghai, China, were conducted, as well as experiments involving the conventional FCM algorithm, the results of which were used for comparative analysis. Next, a supervised classification method was used to validate the clustering results. The final results indicate that the proposed interval-valued FCM clustering is more effective than the conventional FCM clustering method for land cover classification using multi-spectral remote sensing imagery.},

	abstract = {A Boosted Genetic Fuzzy Classifier (BGFC) is proposed in this paper, for land cover classification from multispectral images. The model comprises a set of fuzzy classification rules, which resemble the reasoning employed by humans. Fuzzy rules are generated in an iterative fashion, incrementally covering subspaces of the feature space, as directed by a boosting algorithm. Each rule is able to select the required features, further improving the interpretability of the obtained model. After the rule generation stage, a genetic tuning stage is employed, aiming at improving the cooperation among the fuzzy rules, thus increasing the classification performance attained after the first stage. The BGFC is tested using an IKONOS multispectral VHR image, in a lake–wetland ecosystem of international importance. For effective classification, we consider advanced feature sets, containing spectral and textural feature types. Comparative results with well-known classifiers, commonly employed in remote sensing tasks, indicate that the proposed system is able to handle multi-dimensional feature spaces more efficiently, effectively exploiting information from different feature sources.},

	abstract = {The prevailing concerns on ecological and environmental issues, occurring especially at regional to global scales, have prompted significant advances on the use of remote sensing data for the estimation of land cover information at sub-pixel level. However, the quality of such classification products, as well as the performance of the classification protocol employed, are difficult to quantify. This paper had the objectives of 1) reviewing the existing alternatives, while identifying major drawbacks and desirable properties, for sub-pixel accuracy assessment based on cross-comparison matrices, and 2) developing theoretical grounds, for a more general accuracy assessment of soft classifications, that account for the sub-pixel class distribution uncertainty. It was found that, for a sub-pixel confusion matrix to exhibit a diagonalization characteristic that allows identifying a perfect matching case, the agreement measure must be constrained at pixel level, whereas a disagreement measure can take into account the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty, leading to an underspecified problem termed the sub-pixel area allocation problem. It was demonstrated that the sub-pixel area allocation problem admits a unique solution if, and only if, no more than one class is either over- or underestimated at each pixel. In this case, the sub-pixel confusion can be uniquely determined. When no unique solution exists, the space of feasible solutions can be represented by confusion intervals. A new cross-comparison matrix that reports the confusion intervals in the form of a center value plus–minus maximum error was proposed to account for the sub-pixel distribution uncertainty. The new matrix is referred to as sub-pixel confusion–uncertainty matrix (SCM). Sub-pixel accuracy measures were also derived from this matrix. The practical use of the SCM and derived indices was demonstrated in assessing an invasive species detection method and a fuzzy classification of urban land use/land cover through remote sensing procedures.},

The issue of the sub-pixel area allocation problem (there are infinite solutions for which proportion of the pixel was confused with another if there are multiple classes over/underestimated). To solve that, it is proposed to take the expected value ± the uncertainty of how these proportions are allocated.
An alternative is to take just the expected value, but then if we can quantify the uncertainty, why not do that too?
A fuzzy overall accuracy and kappa value is proposed as well.
All of these, when input is hard, become their traditional hard equivalents. And it is still relatively straight-forward to interpret.
This ought to be implemented as an R package or so!},

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.
Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

Although the proportion occupied by each class in mixed pixels can be determined by spectral unmixing, the spatial distribution of classes remains unknown. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) addresses this problem and a sub-pixel/pixel spatial attraction model (SPSAM) has been introduced to realize SPM. However, this algorithm fails to adequately consider the correlation between sub-pixels. Consequently, the SPM results created by SPSAM are noisy and the accuracy is limited. In this article, a method based on particle swarm optimization is proposed as post-processing on the SPM results obtained with SPSAM. It searches the most likely spatial distribution of classes in each coarse pixel to improve the SPSAM. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide higher accuracy and reduce the noise in the results created by SPSAM. When compared with the available modified pixel-swapping algorithm, the proposed method often yields higher accuracy results.},
